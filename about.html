    <p>I am Julia Haaf, a Berlin based creative, explorer and surfer, who fell in love with the African culture, the people and their land, 
        while living in the small surfing village called ‘Santana’ on the island of São Tomé and Príncipe in central Africa. 
    I have been always drawn to the camera since an early age, being fascinated by its ability to freeze unique and special 
    moments or places. I loved to capture the beauty of the places I visit. Usually I would take a shot of those moments in 
    architecture or landscape, sometimes street photography. For a long time I was looking for my own style and objects that 
    I want to preserve. A style which people could associate with me and my work. After a break from photography I picket up my 
    camera again for my upcoming travel to Africa. </p>
